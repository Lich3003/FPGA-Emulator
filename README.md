# FPGA-Emulator

This will be a momentary description, at the moment you will not find anything ready to use and I would not want this repository to represent that either. I would like it to be a guide for those who come across this topic , I will try to cover every point without leaving anything to chance and if that for many will be boring content , as is this description. Speaking of serious things the ultimate goal will be to make a retroconsole emulator on fpga:
-Making interface for VGA control
-Making CPU
I hope to be able to finish this project and for you who have come across this very preliminary stage if you would like to help me with information I am more than available
